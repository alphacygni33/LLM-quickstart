The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

For the main course we had Veggie Sampler for 2, which lets you choose 4 dishes.  We had Inguday Wat, Shiro Wat, Fosolia, and Ye Abesh Gomen.  The Shiro Wat was fantastic, just the right level of spiciness and a nice complex flavor.  The Inguday Wat and Fosolia were both quite tasty, I'd recommend both.  I found the Ye Abesh Gomen to be rather bland.  The portion size was just right, after dinner and an appetizer there was just enough room for deserts without feeling stuffed.  We tried their baklava ($2), which was good, and a desert that was essentially a Sambussa filled with strawberries and kiwi pieces a la mode, which was amazing.  I also tried their Ethiopian coffee, which was good.  It was earthy and reminded me of Chicory coffee.</td>\n",

I used to regularly enjoy their petite steaks, but now they're just dry, tough, and overcooked.  The pasta dishes may or may not be worth considering.  The crab legs on occasion are just bad.  At times, I have wondered if they were left over from Sunday brunch.

And our appetizer of grilled octopus really was delicious -- best thing we ate here by far.\\n\\nThen it all went downhill with the entrees. When we were ordering, we were warned by our server that the black spaghetti was very salty and to reconsider ordering it if we weren't into that. When we asked if it was possible to make it less salty, he said no. That's fine, I can understand chefs not wanting to change their dishes and cater to their diners' whims. So we ordered other things, figuring better safe than sorry...\\n\\nHoly salt lick, Batman! Every single one of our 5 entrees (spaghetti with garlic and lobster, orecchiette, bucatini all'Amatriciana, bone marrow ravioli, and lamb chops) was oversalted, ranging from that's-pretty-salty to almost inedible. So I can't even begin to imagine how salty the black spaghetti would've been...\\n\\nLiving in NYC, we get to eat a lot of amazing Italian, from homey and rustic to modern and upscale. So we had prepared ourselves to eat mediocre yet pricey Italian in Vegas, but this failed to meet even our very low expectations. Don't know how there can be so many good reviews of this place -- maybe they're more attentive with the tasting menus (which they did try hard to sell us on, but we just weren't that hungry). But after this experience, we def won't be back, and I doubt we'll be checking out one of their other joints any time soon.</td>\n",
